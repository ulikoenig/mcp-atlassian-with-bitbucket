# Test scenarios for AttachmentsMixin
#
# 1. Single Attachment Download (download_attachment method):
#    - Success case: Downloads attachment correctly with proper HTTP response
#    - Path handling: Converts relative path to absolute path
#    - Error cases:
#      - No URL provided
#      - HTTP error during download
#      - File write error
#      - File not created after write operation
#
# 2. Issue Attachments Download (download_issue_attachments method):
#    - Success case: Downloads all attachments for an issue
#    - Path handling: Converts relative target directory to absolute path
#    - Edge cases:
#      - Issue has no attachments
#      - Issue not found
#      - Issue has no fields
#      - Some attachments fail to download
#      - Attachment has missing URL
#
# 3. Single Attachment Upload (upload_attachment method):
#    - Success case: Uploads file correctly
#    - Path handling: Converts relative file path to absolute path
#    - Error cases:
#      - No issue key provided
#      - No file path provided
#      - File not found
#      - API error during upload
#      - No response from API
#
# 4. Multiple Attachments Upload (upload_attachments method):
#    - Success case: Uploads multiple files correctly
#    - Partial success: Some files upload successfully, others fail
#    - Error cases:
#      - Empty list of file paths
#      - No issue key provided

    mfv2, f26r, 9547, cc5h (read half), and the 6vmq download-overwrite variant.

    The download side gained ``validate_safe_path`` (CVE-2026-27825), but the
    upload path used to feed any caller-supplied ``file_path`` to the API after
    only an ``os.path.exists`` check, so a path outside the workspace was read and
    exfiltrated. These tests assert the secure outcome: a traversal/absolute path
    never reaches the upload sink.

    Assertions target the *sink* (``add_attachment`` not called), not an exception
    type, because ``upload_attachment`` wraps its body in ``except Exception`` and
    returns an error dict — so the fix may reject by raising or by returning a dict,
    and either way the secret must never reach the API.
